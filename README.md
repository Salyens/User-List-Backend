# User Collections Project - Backend

Developed during an internship at "Intransition", this backend focuses on reliability and functionality, integrating various technologies and practices for a comprehensive user experience.

## Backend Features

### Environment Configuration
- Uses `dotenv` for managing environment variables.

### Server Setup
- Express.js web framework.
- Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling.
- CORS for cross-origin resource sharing.

## Routing and Middleware

### Express Routing
- RESTful API routes for managing users and collections.
- Multer middleware for file uploads.

### Data Models
- Mongoose schemas for user items, supporting additional fields and full-text search.

### Validation
- Data request validation using express-validator.

## Key Technologies
